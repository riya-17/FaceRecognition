# Face Recognizer
Face Recognizer identifies the face of an individual by their name with the help of their facial features. <br><br>
Face Recognizer uses deep learning algorithms to compare a live capture or digital image with the stored faceprints(also known as datasets) to verify an identity.<br><br>
The algorithm used for classification is [k-NN model i.e. k-Nearest Neighbor classifier](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/08/08/k-nn-classifier-for-image-classification/). It uses Euclidean distance to compare images for similarity. <br><br>  

# Prerequisites

### Install cmake library

```

    ### Further error can be solved
    - On installing opencv:
        ```https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/28/ubuntu-18-04-how-to-install-opencv/```
    - On dlib:
        ```https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/03/27/how-to-install-dlib/```
    

### Set the path of the input images in the code and run the following command:

```
python FaceRecognizer.py
```

# How Does It Work?
 ### * An image that contains the face to be recognized is loaded (e.g., input image).
 ### * The face is detected and segmented.
 ### * The face is aligned if it is not aligned straight
 ### * Landmarks (e.g., 68 (x, y) coordinates) are detected from the facial structure.
 ### * The detected face landmarks are encoded (e.g., 128-d embeddings of the image are created).
 ### * The input image[encoding] is passed to the k-NN model for classification.
 ### * The k-NN model returns the name with the highest precision 
<br><br>
# Outputs:

* Input Image - The image in which faces are to be recognized:

![Input Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25060937/43034709-54d27858-8cff-11e8-8247-2a92cc6e4119.PNG)<br><br>

* Original Image - The cropped input image

* Aligned Image - Aligning the image increases the efficiency of the algorithm

* Landmarks - Shows the landmarks of the detected faces

* Detected Face - The face is recognized and the name of the recognized face is displayed along with the face. If the face does not belong to the dataset then the face is labeled as Unknown.

### encode-faces.py

It is used to create 128-d face embeddings of the input image as well as custom dataset. These embeddings are used to compare input image(embeddings) with the dataset(embeddings). The one with the highest votes is preferred.<br><br>
